## Featured Project Repos

<!--School of Code (https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) projects with HTML, CSS,
Javascript, React, Typescript, Node, Express, REST APIs, Jest, Cypress, Git and
Github, to name but a few of the technologies we got to grips with. The bootcamp
culminated in a gruelling, four-week, group project: six people; four intense
weeks; pair-programming from inception to full stack demo for **Raduno! Catch up
without the fuss!** a responsive web app designed to streamline arranging big
group events, whichm, as we know, can be like herding cats. -->

## Experience

<!--Working as a full stack developer for close to 10 years, on a range of different
tech stacks (PHP, Perl, Ab Initio, PL/SQL, SQL, BroadVision, CA-OpenROAD &
Ingres, MySQL, Microsoft SQLServer, Oracle) and on complex, multi-million pound
projects. I then forked my career into business analysis and project management
for several years, before merging back into my first love, coding. -->
