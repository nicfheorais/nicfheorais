## Current

Recently graduated from School of Code bootcamp
(https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) having produced projects using HTML, CSS,
Javascript, React, Typescript, Node, Express, REST APIs, Jest, Cypress, Git and
Github, to name but a few of the technologies we got to grips with, culminating
in a gruelling, four-week, group project: six people; four intense weeks;
pair-programming from inception to full stack demo for Raduno! a responsive web
app designed to solve the problem of arranging big group events 'without the
fuss'

| Front end for **Raduno! Catch up without the fuss!** - a responsive web app (React, HTML, CSS, Cypress) to make it easier to plan group activites. Chat, invitation and group voting features. Design documentation included. _Next steps are to complete implementation of real-time chat using socket.io on front and back end._                                                                                         | https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project-front-end-hexcode |
| Back end for **Raduno!** - mutiple RESTful APIs (Node, Express), with migration + seed scripts for a PostgreSQL database, hosted on Heroku. Automated testing through Jest and Super Test are currently being added. Domain model, logical and physical datamodels, and API-Front End mapping diagram stored alongside the code. _Next steps are to complete the back end APIs required, and to transition to Typescript._ | https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project-repo-hexcode      |
| **Country Quiz Web App** - Gives you a series of hints and you have to guess the country. Initial build using React, HTML and CSS. Using a 3rd party API for the country facts. Work in progress. _Currently re-factoring to use Typescript and improving use of React Hooks._                                                                                                                                             | https://github.com/nicfheorais/country-api-quiz                 |
| Very early days on this. Designed. Build starting next week. Aim is to create a simple **calculator in React** to practice our Typescript, pair-programming and Test Driven Design with Jest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://github.com/nicfheorais/2022-02-11-calculator-react-jest |

## Experience

I was a full stack developer for close to 10 years back in the day, working on a
range of different tech stacks (PHP, Perl, Ab Initio, PL/SQL, SQL, BroadVision,
CA-OpenROAD & Ingres, MySQL, Microsoft SQLServer, Oracle) and on complex,
multi-million pound projects. I then forked my career into business analysis and
project management for several years, before merging back into my first love,
coding.
